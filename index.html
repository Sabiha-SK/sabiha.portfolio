                        <p>In this project, I tackled the critical issue of customer churn for a telecom company by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer behavior data, I developed a Decision Tree model in R that improved churn prediction accuracy and reduced churn rates by 15%. The project involved data cleaning, feature selection, and evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model. I created interactive visualizations using Qlik to present insights into customer segments at risk of leaving. 
                            These insights enabled the company to develop targeted retention strategies, ultimately boosting customer satisfaction and business profitability.<br>

                        <p>This project focused on designing and implementing an anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to safeguard network security. Using Python and machine learning techniques, I developed a system capable of identifying malicious activities with high accuracy. By leveraging algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and KNN, the IDS achieved a 98.39% detection rate on the KDD'99 dataset. Statistical analysis and feature selection were performed to optimize the model's performance and reduce false positives. This system empowers organizations to monitor network traffic effectively, detect potential threats, and respond proactively to cyber incidents.</p>
